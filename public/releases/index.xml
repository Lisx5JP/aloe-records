      <description>Simple block structures, great dynamics with great noise, and perhaps a little mystery to it. Alone002 new cassette release “it works” is a conceptual collection of works by Beijing, China based musician/poet Yan Jun, from one live improvisation to two performance recordings composed by Ryoko Akama. &amp;ldquo;sometimes people concern if one piece of work good enough. or more detailed, is it a pleasure of listening? or is it unique? sometimes also argue &amp;ldquo;is it art/music or not&amp;rdquo;, or what kind of music is it and what kind of standard we should apply to value it.</description>

      <description>Alone Series 001 is absolutely delighted to release a new album by Beijing, China-based musician Zhu Wenbo, entitled &amp;ldquo;Four Lines and Improvisation&amp;rdquo;, recorded in August 2022. Zhu Wenbo is a multi-instrumentalist and composer who is dedicated to &amp;ldquo;music that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like music&amp;rdquo;. He also runs the label Zoomin’ Night. The album contains two tracks: ”Four Lines”(A-side) and “Improvisation”(B), released in one limited edition cassette. Both tracks naturally showcase the Lo-Fi nature of experimental composition/electro-acoustic improvisation that has always been a hallmark of Zhu Wenbo&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>
