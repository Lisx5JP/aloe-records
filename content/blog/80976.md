`Question: Kyle Mullin`

`Answer: Sun Yizhou`

**1. Tell me about founding Aloe Records. How has this experience been, and what do you want to achieve with it?** 

Aloe Records was founded in 2022. I‘m responsible for most of the distribution and publishing by myself, along with three other friends: Li Yakun, Zhang Cai and Bian Xingchi, who helped me with record design, translation and maintaining the website.

2022 was a unique year for Chinese musicians. There were many gig cancellations, neighborhood closures, travel restrictions, protests…for some, it was hard enough to survive, things one can only understand in person. My instinctive reaction was to look outward from myself to find some connection. I made many recordings at home, some of my own and some in collaboration with others. In the process, I slowly wanted to reduce "myself" and make some releases for others. Thus, Aloe Records was born.

Aloe Records has released two tapes so far, and there will be more publications in the future, unlimited medium. The label is an extension of what I've been doing and I have no more ambitions besides itself. It is growing as I myself change. For me now, going slowly and low-key, everything is facing uncertainty.

**2. How does it feel to put out Yan Jun and Zhu Wenbo's music on your new label, and what do you think about this new music?**

When it comes to the choice of releases, I prefer musicians that have influenced me, or live pieces that have touched me in the past. Yan Jun and Zhu Wenbo are definitely two of them. I will briefly introduce their works.

Yan Jun - It works

A block structured piece joint of loud noise and small silence. Yan Jun has a belief in using cheaper/less equipment and simple concepts to oppose the systemic "noise music", which is one of his many things that inspired me.

Zhu Wenbo - Four Lines and Improvisation

In the 2017-19 Beijing New Music Scene, improvised music needs to find a breakthrough by incorporating the rules of rationalism and suppressing the emotional part of improvisation, i.e. composing based on improvisation. I think this new work is the result of and reflection after that period of fermentation.

**3. Michael Pettis told me improvization musicans and venues make any music scene better in general. In Beijing, for example, members of famous rock bands had improviation side projects, and this helped push their overall creativity in other genres. He also said this is very good for a music scene in general.** 

**What are your thoughts on this? What experiences do you have in this regard that inform you opinions?**

Ha! Many friends would say that every improv musician in China has one rock band, if not more! It really seems like that's the case. On the one hand it's the rock music tradition of the Chinese underground since the 90's, on the other hand it's true that bands flow into the experimental/improvised music scene with more audience and capital, but it's not really that much.

As for me, that's probably not my era ...... at least not for me at the moment. I don't know how to play an instrument, much less a guitar, and have trouble fitting into a traditional band arrangement. Or maybe no one wants to play in a band with me, I don't know. There is no reference value here.

**4. What do you think about the experimental music scene in Beijing in general these days?**

In these three years of covid-pandemic, Beijing has become less connected to foreign scenes and more connected to scenes around the country. It's bad, and good. A change in the musicians' creativity and mentality has also occurred, but they may be the only ones who know it. The recent loosening of the prevention policy in the country would have been a bit sudden for anyone, and I don't think Beijing was prepared for it. The numbers of gigs are gradually returning to pre-covid time, so maybe this year will be slightly different from the last three years.

`问: Kyle Mullin`

`​答: 孙一舟`

**1.请告诉我创建芦荟唱片的情况。这段经历如何，你对它有什么追求？**

芦荟唱片是在2022年开始创办的。主要是我一个人去负责发行出版上的绝大部分事，还有其他三位朋友：李亚坤、张采、边星驰，帮助我唱片设计、翻译文字、维护网站方面的工作。

2022年对于中国乐手来说是个特殊的一年。许多演出被迫取消，小区封控，限制出行，抗议活动等等。对于一部分人来说生存就是难题，有些事情只有亲身体会才能明白。我本能地反应就是从自身向外寻找一些联系，我就在家录了许多录音作品，有的是我个人的，有的是与他人合作的。在这个过程中，我慢慢想把“我自己”去掉，给别人做一些发行。于是，芦荟唱片诞生了。

芦荟唱片目前发行了两张磁带作品，未来还会更多，它的出版物不限于任何介质。我对它没有更多的追求，只是我自己一直在做的事情的延伸。我自身变化的同时它也在生长。对现在的我来说，慢慢的低调去做，一切都面临着不确定。

**2. 在你的新厂牌上推出颜峻和朱文博的音乐，感觉如何，你对这些新音乐有何看法？**

在发行作品的选择上，我更想去发行对我有影响的乐手或者过去打动过我的现场作品。颜峻和朱文博绝对算是两位。我来简单介绍一下他们的作品吧：

颜峻-管用

 一部块状结构的，大音量噪音与小声儿寂静并存的作品。颜峻有一种用更廉价/少的设备和简单的概念去反对已成系统的“噪音音乐”的信念，这种信念也是启发我许多中的一点。

朱文博-四句与即兴

在北京新音乐场景的2017-19年里，即兴音乐需要找到一个突破口，融入理性主义的规则，抑制掉即兴中感性的表现的部分，也就是基于即兴的作曲。我想这部新作是经历了那段时间的发酵后的结果，也是反思。

**3. Michael Pettis告诉我，即兴乐手和场所使任何音乐场景普遍变得更好。例如在北京，著名摇滚乐队的成员都有即兴创作的副业，这有助于推动他们在其他类型的整体创造力。他还说这对整个音乐场景来说是非常好的。**

**你对此有什么看法？你在这方面有什么经验可以为你的观点提供参考？**

啊哈，很多朋友会说，中国的每一个即兴乐手都有一支摇滚乐队，甚至多支！看起来好像真的是这样子。一方面是中国地下音乐90年代以来的摇滚乐传统，另一方面确实乐队会向实验/即兴音乐的场景流入更多受众和资本，但其实也并不是那么多。

至于我呢，那可能不是我的年代……至少我目前没有。我不会乐器，更不会弹吉他，难以融入传统乐队的编排。也可能没有人愿意和我玩乐队吧，我不知道。这里没有任何参考价值。

**4.你对现在北京的实验音乐场景有什么看法？**

在这三年防疫中，北京与国外场景的联系更少了，与国内各地场景的联系更多了。是坏事，也是好事。乐手们的创作和心态也产生了变化，但也可能就他/她们自己知道。最近北京放宽防疫政策，这对任何人都会有些突然，我想北京没做好准备。演出逐步恢复正常，可能今年会和以往三年稍有不同了。
