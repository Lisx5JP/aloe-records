I shall start from the recent past.

Shit happened in year 2022, quite a lot, Beijing in particular. Each morning you and I wake up petrified, bumped into some fucked-up incident through social media, insulted by another sealed matter that is unable-to-view. Incomprehensible at first, we erupted into fury, ended up with complaint. Among all matters, what’s closely related to this article is the current situation of Chinese musicians, with fewer gigs than in previous years and patches and patches of cancelled touring around the country. Music venues are facing closure or switching their operations to find alternative ways to stay afloat.

I ask myself, where will I and my friends be able to perform next? If none, what can I do instead? I started making recording works, solo projects and collaborations. During the period, probably one April morning, somewhere between those walls as I was locked at home, I thought, well, then why not start a new label from scratch! It is something I been thinking for long but never really made up the mind. Because it would mean cutting a part of my life to it, consuming a lot of time, money, making contact with people, like getting samples from manufacturers and all sorts of chores; More crucially it is about why it exists and what to do with it in long term… But out of practical urgency, It’s time.

With help from my friend Li Yakun as graphic designer, Bian Xingchi built the website and Zhang Cai with translations… slowly preparing one after another, adjusting little by little, a daily habit it has become, there’s one small announcement I would like to make now.

It’s called aloe record.

I wanted it to be a mini-label that is not too eye-catching nor expressive, however sharp and powerful. As it crossed my mind, I subconsciously touched the edge of an aloe vera on my balcony (I have plenty at home, my parents keep them). Ha! Might as well call it aloe! (a plant that grows in subtropics and tropics, with long-pointed leaves, spiny edges, and thick, juicy interior. Kept in many Chinese homes for ornamental and herbal medicine use.)

And the music, the music may not sound very music-ic. Let go of the term. However, if we must apply a certain coherent to it, may have something to do with the underground Beijing scene that influenced me, since 2018 pre-covid, the very moment I got involved with this kind of music, as audience, and as participance. For me, it pulled me back to the time I heard Song of the Youths (Gesang der Jünglinge) for the first time, in person. After all, the independent label run by the musician is to some extent unavoidably an autobiography of the individual, his condensed passion for those he loves. And of course, its’ chosen genealogy. Which can partially traced back to The New York School after late 60s, Fluxes, noise music, electronic acoustic… But there were a larger part came from the later improvised music from 2000 onwards (improvised music after saying goodbye to rock and jazz), EAI, Onkyo, Echtzeitmusik, eclecticism, compositions based on improvisation, as well as conceptual music or sound works, unclassifiable non-music, etc. Clarification as such has nothing to do with nostalgia, an aloe would keep growing. And I would prefer it to have the reach to withstand more radical or obscure sound practices, to pick its way out of the chaos, and locate itself to the consistence that comes from deep within.

Aloe Record is currently self-run and will remain so. Publications are not medium-restricted, containing DIY sections.  Dedicated to make various connections with others, between different people, societies, lives, I expect it to gradually grow into a central-less and continuous international network for contemporary musicians and sound artists, conceptual artists, media artists and performance artists…a goal which is of course far, far away today.

The first publishings will be Alo(n)e series, aloe record’s solo project release for musician or a long-term music group, mainly some friends I invited. The series will be released on a total of six cassettes, in 50 limited copies each. I ask the designer to keep it simple, monotonous and mechanical; as plain and non-redundant as possible. Even though It might not sell, it has to be a physical album, the kind you can hold in your hand and touch, that's the bottom line. 

**Alone-001 & 002 will be out via our Bandcamp on 10th December 2022.**

![001#Four Lines and Improvisation is a new album by Beijing’s musician and label organizer Zhu Wenbo, measuring in 32’41’’ length. With new notes written for his ‘compositions based on improvisations’, he recorded 'Four Lines' in August 2022 on which 'Improvisation' is based on. Both tracks showcase a distinctive loose nature to the sound.](/images/uploads/zhu1-a.jpg)

![002#It Works is a new cassette release by Beijing-based musician/poet Yan Jun. Consists of one live improvisation and two takes of performance recordings composed by Ryoko Akama. The album has a simple block structure, great dynamics with great noise, and perhaps a little mystery to it.](/images/uploads/yan2-a.jpg)

Four Lines and Improvisation&It Works will be available for pre-order on Bandcamp on December 2nd. Officially released on December 10th.

Stay tuned. Thanks!
