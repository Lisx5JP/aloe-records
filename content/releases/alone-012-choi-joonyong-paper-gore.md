'paper-gore' was recorded during his 2011 STEIM residency in Amsterdam (accompanied by Ryu Hankil and Hong Chulki). Remixed and mastered after 14 years. This is a fascinating album where frequencies, dynamics, left and right channels are pushed to the limit. Choi Joonyong touches the fast-spinning VCRs with paper, and the friction affects the rotation speed, leaving noise, sharp high frequencies that pierce the ears, and sometimes distorted low frequencies from the paper slapping. In addition to the hum of the machine, the physical properties of the paper also cause a subtle change in the sound.

Choi Joonyong is a bad voice of noise / experimental / improvised music in Seoul. He runs a record label called "Balloon & Needle" with Hong Chulki. He also plays bass in the doom metal band Vomit & Tear. In 1996, he formed Astronoise (Korea's first noise project) with Hong Chulki. In the early days, he accidentally created light industrial electronic noise using playback devices such as CD players, MP3 players, tape players, VCRs and speakers... In his solo performances in recent years, he has moved towards a more conceptual post-Fluxus performance, interested in the control and failure of playing through improvisation and composition.
