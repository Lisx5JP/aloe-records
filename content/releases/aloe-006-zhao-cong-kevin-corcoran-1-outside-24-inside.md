'-1 outside / 24 inside' was recorded after the duo's performance at Aloe on-site #20. The two tracks were captured separately: one evening in an underground pass-way, and another during daytime in a studio. Both locations are venues in Beijing that consistently hold experimental music concerts. Resonating with the album title on both metaphorical and geographical levels. With their playing, you can hear the touch of the musicians' hand, hear the variations between amplified and un-amplified objects, and how sounds change in different spaces.
