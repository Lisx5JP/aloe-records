Leo Okagawa is a sound artist based in Tokyo, Japan. He started recording environmental sounds in 2014, and around that time he started making multilayered collage works from elements of recorded sounds, analog machine’s noise, and simple electric tones. He has also been working on an improvised performance since 2017. Using some electronic devices, he explores the structural possibilities of sound through the combination of simple tones.
