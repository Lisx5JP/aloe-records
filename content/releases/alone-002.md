Simple block structures, great dynamics with great noise, and perhaps a little mystery to it. Alone002 new cassette release “it works” is a conceptual collection of works by Beijing, China based musician/poet Yan Jun, from one live improvisation to two performance recordings composed by Ryoko Akama. 

"sometimes people concern if one piece of work good enough. or more detailed, is it a pleasure of listening? or is it unique? sometimes also argue "is it art/music or not", or what kind of music is it and what kind of standard we should apply to value it. or where is it in a family tree and which tree is it. etc. i don't care about these. i care does it work? or does it exist? alive? able to connect to others? and so on. 

a friend of mine said she always wants to hit the wall with her head when my music is in the ears. i think that's fantastic. hit, my friend, hit it harder!" —Yan Jun
