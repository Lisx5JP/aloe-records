'Synthetic Weather Reporter' consists of two tracks with different textures. Track 1 unfolds slowly like a rain shower, from soft and delicate sweet bubbles to overloaded dark and dangerous clouds, from far away to in front of you, where the raindrops will hit you. Track 2 has a musique concrète tradition, consisting entirely of vocal samples, as if amplifying Alvin Lucier's stuttering moments over and over again, many of the sounds are mistakes that one would hope to avoid in voice recording technology, but ayrtbh organizes them in a frenzied fashion. It's full of richly textured sound synthesis and momentum, with a touch of programmer's black comedy.
