The album 'Cymbals and Night' is a combination of field recordings and free improvisation. It's all recorded on a low fidelity iPhone, which doesn't have the "purity" of live listening. Many different noises interact with each other in the phone's own compression and signal-to-noise ratio algorithms. There is no such thing as perfection on this album. The unintentional humming of the baritone, the friction between the stone and the concrete, you can hear him playing, walking, and so on. When he stops playing, the sound of the wind accompanied by the chirping of insects brings you imagination.
