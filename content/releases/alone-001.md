description: When listening to his compositions and improvisations, the two seem
  to be inherent in each other and difficult to distinguish.

Alone Series 001 is absolutely delighted to release a new album by Beijing, China-based musician Zhu Wenbo, entitled "Four Lines and Improvisation", recorded in August 2022. Zhu Wenbo is a multi-instrumentalist and composer who is dedicated to "music that doesn't sound like music". He also runs the label Zoomin’ Night. 

The album contains two tracks: ”Four Lines”(A-side) and “Improvisation”(B), released in one limited edition cassette. Both tracks naturally showcase the Lo-Fi nature of experimental composition/electro-acoustic improvisation that has always been a hallmark of Zhu Wenbo's work. 

"Four Lines" is a piece of Zhu’s recent composition with notes, a combination of high frequency sine wave electronics and low volume vocals, in which he murmurs a part (using a loudspeaker as microphone) and plays a part with an electronic oscillator. 'Improvisation' using a clarinet and a snare drum. With both sides of the snare drum act as microphones, the amplification of the snare drum generates feedback with the monitors; the clarinet plays a little from "Four Lines" composition and improvised the rest. The acoustic instruments and the electronic feedback are tapped against each other in a dry, slightly psychedelic way.
