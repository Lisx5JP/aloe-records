"Fat City is my first band. Ma Meng and I started rehearsal in late 2008, and we stopped activities at the beginning of 2013. At that time we really wrote a bunch of songs. Thanks to some suitable opportunities, I decided to do a special performance at Xiaozu Works on November 1st, 2024, using the lyrics of Fat City as performing materials. I printed all these lyrics on paper, and during the performance I cut them into fragments and picked them randomly and read. The process lasted long time, meanwhile I used a four-track cassette recorder recording and playing back. Forward, reverse, fast and slow. Twenty four lyrics in total. This is all the lyrics I can find, but there are still some forgotten. Now these songs sound like the same song. They have always been like this. " - Zhu Wenbo

Zhu Wenbo is a multi-instrumentalist and composer who is dedicated to "music that doesn't sound like music", and he has released 'Four Lines and Improvisation' (Alone-001) and 'Jyunishi 十二支' (Aloe-003) on Aloe Records. Fat City was a band that contains elements of lo-fi, krautrock, noise rock, etc., it is one of the representatives of Beijing D-22 underground rock memories. Years later, during a performance at the Xiaozu Works, Zhu Wenbo somehow decided to cut and read the lyrics while the four-track recorder slowly spun. The collage style seems to have shades of William S. Burroughs and David Lynch.
