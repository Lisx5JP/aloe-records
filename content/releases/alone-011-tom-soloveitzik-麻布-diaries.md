'麻布 diaries' recorded while Tom was living in Japan, most of the sounds come from his practice at home. The sound is quiet, subdued, intriguing and full of detail. On track 2, if you listen closely, you can hear the clarinetist practicing in another room as Tom taps his thumb on the reed, which he describes himself as an invisible metronome. Last track is a field recording from Zao onsen (2023, a ski resort north of Fukushima. Tom placed the recorder inside the saxophone to record. If the track 2 is amplifying the room/space with the use of the saxophone as an object the track from Zao onsen listens to the saxophone as an historic and social phenomena, from the outside.

“'麻布 diaries' is intended to be read and pronounced in English as Azabu diaries (Azabu is a neighborhood in Tokyo). However, as Sun Yizhou kindly pointed out, the term has a different meaning in Chinese, translating to 'linen.' Ultimately, the interpretation is left to the listener's discretion.” - Tom Soloveitzik
