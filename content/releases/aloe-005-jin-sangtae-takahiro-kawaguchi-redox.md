description: What can be revealed is that, Kawaguchi use dripping water from
  suspended infusion containers onto a smartphone running a music application,
  producing unpredictable sounds. In addition to this, Jin has developed his
  latest hard drive system, a personalized system of acoustic/electronic
  percussion -- equally full of unpredictability. The two artists'
  semi-automated systems share distinct roles, functioning like two band
  members.

This album originated from Takahiro Kawaguchi's short visit to Seoul last year, where he held recording sessions at dotolim, Seoul's historic experimental music venue. What can be revealed is that, Kawaguchi use dripping water from suspended infusion containers onto a smartphone running a music application, producing unpredictable sounds. In addition to this, Jin has developed his latest hard drive system, a personalized system of acoustic/electronic percussion -- equally full of unpredictability. The two artists' semi-automated systems share distinct roles, functioning like two band members.

Jin Sangtae is a Seoul based sound artist and improviser. He is interested in reconstruction of non-instrumental material from his life experience. Working at an electronic market in Seoul, he began using mechanical computer hard drives for improvised music and this has become his main instrument. In addition, he uses laptop, radio and electronic/acoustic car horns. Takahiro Kawaguchi is Tokyo based sound artist and improviser. The objects used in Kawaguchi’s performances and installations apparently seem strange, but most of them are the ensemble of phenomena which surface by liberating the daily goods from their uses or definition. He uses things anyone can get, converted everyday materials, and so on, but the effects are far more extended from their original potential ones.
