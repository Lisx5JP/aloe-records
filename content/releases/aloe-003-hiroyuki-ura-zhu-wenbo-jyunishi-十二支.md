Zhu Wenbo is a multi-instrumentalist and composer who is dedicated to "music that doesn't sound like music". and he has released「Four Lines and Improvisation」on Aloe Records.



Hiroyuki Ura and Zhu Wenbo collaborate across Tokyo and Beijing. This is a new album by the two musicians, who have been exchanging recordings and re-creating them using the "tape loop" method of composition. The two have been creating music using this "tape loop" method for several years now, but in a slightly different way. Side A of the cassette features Hiroyuki Ura processing Zhu's sound material, and side B vice versa. They have known each other for many years and this is their first album together.
