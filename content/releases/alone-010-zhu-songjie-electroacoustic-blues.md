"Recorded in September 2024, Shanghai. Electric guitar, synthesizer, effect pedals, line selectors, Ebow, clippers and some other equipments are used during the home recording session. Track 3 is a cover of Albert King’s Born Under A Bad Sign, and Track 6 is a cover of Mississippi Fred McDowell’s When I Lay My Burden Down.

Electroacoustic Blues literaly consists of two different parts: the electricoacoustic sound and Blues. It experimented with different ways of disassembly, combination, and interaction between these two elements internally and externally. During the whole recording session, my hands were only on the guitar(mostly for the blues part), while my feet controlling the electricoacoustic set through the touchpad on the synth and two expression pedals. In tracks 2, 5, and 7, the electroacoustic part make sounds through its internal feedback loop, sometimes affected by the input of the electric guitar, and sometimes not. On the electricland, the ghost of Blues was running on its own rhythm." - Zhu Songjie
