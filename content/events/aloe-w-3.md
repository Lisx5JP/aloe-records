This year, several musicians performing at Salle des FÃªtes have released albums on the Beijing-based label Aloe Records: Yan Jun, Soviet Pop (members of Ghostmass) and Sun Yizhou. This label was founded by Zhang Cai and Sun Yizhou, who also organise concerts in Beijing. To introduce their practices, together with Yan Jun they are offering a (non-)workshop where no one knows what will happen. Will it be a reading or a performance? Will they discuss the experimental scene in Beijing during or after the performance? Will they create a performance with mirrors, where the audience and everything in the room become part of it? The only certainty: they want this performance/reading/workshop to relate directly to the audience present at HumuS.
